* Introduction

This repository is a collection of shell scripts and configuration
files used to manage AWS EMR clusters (tested on small clusters).

* Setup

- ~common/~ has utilities, and common variables used in the scripts.

- AWS account specific variables are defined in ~common/conf~, however
  it is not included in the source tree due to security reasons.  A
  template ~common/conf~ is shown below:

  #+begin_example
    # Amazon EC2 options
    declare SUBNET="SubnetId=<my-subnet>"
    declare KEYS="KeyName=<mykey>"

    # Amazon S3 config
    declare BUCKET=<my-bucket>
    declare LOG_BUCKET=<my-log-bucket>/elasticmapreduce
  #+end_example

- Other configuration files are available under ~etc/~.
  - Cluster configuration is in ~etc/cluster-conf.json~
  - Instance configurations are in ~etc/instance-groups-*.json~
